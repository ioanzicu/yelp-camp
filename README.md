## A simple yelp camp web platform

A simple web site for posting camps around the world, with login/logout functionality, 
coments and implementation of the web API maps, 
for showing geolocation of the camp based on the geografical coordinates like latitude and longitude. 
This project helped me to learn back-end technologies: Node.js (Express, Mongoose, Passport.js) and MongoDB, and practie my frontend skills: HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4 framework.
